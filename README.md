# Clash Rules for Mainland China

`acl4ssr-ai-chain-v2.ini` is a subconverter external configuration, not a
standalone Clash/Mihomo YAML file. Supply it as the converter's `config`
parameter together with your subscription. A working proxy subscription is
still required.

## Routing Defaults

- Known domestic applications, domestic AI services and domestic download CDNs
  use DIRECT.
- Overseas AI, social, streaming and game services use their respective groups.
- Microsoft and Apple groups default to DIRECT, but can be switched to a proxy.
- Games and unmatched traffic default to node selection. DIRECT remains an
  explicit option.
- aria2 and FDM follow destination rules, just like a browser. Selected BT
  clients use DIRECT only after known destination rules have been checked.
- No advertising blocklist or unconditional unblocking allowlist is imported.

Existing clients can restore saved group selections. After updating, check the
game and unmatched-traffic groups: a previously saved DIRECT selection may
override the new defaults.

Overseas AI uses VPSDance's Quantumult X list because it excludes whole-process
rules. The `quanx:` prefix is required: subconverter must translate `HOST` rules
to Clash domain rules. Do not replace it with the Surge list, whose process rules
would also proxy domestic requests from Cursor, Codex and other AI clients.

## Optional Residential Proxies

The AI and social groups prefer the existing US/Austria residential node names
using anchored subscription-name filters. Missing nodes are skipped and the
groups fall back to node selection; no undefined proxy reference is emitted.
This template does not construct proxy chains.

Nodes or groups created later by a client override are not visible to
subconverter's filters. That override must both create the chain and add its
name to the relevant group's proxy list.

## Client Prerequisites

- Configure DNS in the client or converter base. Proxy routing alone does not
  prevent DNS pollution or force DNS requests through a proxy. Configure
  bootstrap/proxy-server DNS to avoid resolution loops.
- Configure TUN or another transparent mode when UDP and non-HTTP applications
  need coverage. System HTTP proxy settings alone do not capture all traffic.
- Cover IPv6 consistently in DNS and routing, or disable it consistently if
  the client/network cannot handle it.
- Process rules require local process identification. A router cannot identify
  processes on downstream devices; process-based TikTok and BT exceptions will
  not apply there.
- STUN rules require a UDP-capable proxy and do not replace browser WebRTC
  privacy settings.
- Keep session-sensitive services on a stable exit. Using load balancing can
  send related domains through different exits; use the same exit for AI
  sessions and shared authentication/challenge services when necessary.

## Verification

Run from the repository root:

```powershell
python -B -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python -B tests/test_rules.py --online -v
python -B tests/test_rules.py --generated-yaml path/to/converted.yaml -v
```

Online and generated-YAML checks require PyYAML. `--cache-dir PATH` saves fetched
rule sources for inspection. Tests cover rule order, destination/process routing,
default group choices and generated proxy references. Validate converted YAML
with your actual core too, for example `mihomo -t -f path/to/converted.yaml`.
These checks do not establish real network reachability or DNS/WebRTC privacy.
